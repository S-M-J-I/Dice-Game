# Dice-Game
A simple dice game with DOM manipulation. I'm a nomad learning JS and its applications in the browser. This is my first project with DOM.

Click on any dice to see its face change. Highest dice face wins the game and a total number of two dice face added is displayed.

Also, click on the big crimson header to see a little easter egg ðŸ¥š
